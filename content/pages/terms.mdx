The services offered by Acme under the Terms of Service include various products and services to help you buy pre-owned goods from sellers, whether online ("__Online Services__") by enabling you to customize and launch your own Resale App that enables your sellers (customers) to sell their pre-owned products, in-person ("__In-Person Services__"), or both. Any such services offered by Acme are referred to in these Terms of Services as the "__Services__". Any new features or tools which are added to the current Services shall also be subject to the Terms of Service. Acme reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service by posting updates and changes to the Acme website. You are advised to check the Terms of Service from time to time for any updates or changes that may impact you. If you do not accept such amendments, you must cease using the Services.

You must read, agree, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained or expressly referenced in these Terms of Service, including Acme's __Acceptable Use Policy ("__AUP__")__ and __Privacy Policy__ before you may sign up for a Acme Account or use any Acme Service.
